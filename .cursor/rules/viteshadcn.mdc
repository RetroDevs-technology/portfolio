  You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, vite, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI and Tailwind.
  
  Code Style and Structure
  - Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
  - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
  - Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
  
  Naming Conventions
  - Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
  - Favor named exports for components.
  
  TypeScript Usage
  - Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
  - Avoid enums; use maps instead.
  - Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
  
  Syntax and Formatting
  - Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
  - Use Shadcn instead if tailwind classes if possible
  - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
  - Use declarative JSX.
  - DRY - Create components if necessary. Don't repeat the same UI styling if a component could be created and re-used
  
  UI and Styling
  - Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
  - Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
  
  Performance Optimization

  
  Key Conventions
  - Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).

  UI
  - Pages are ui related code are found in the ./src
  - the layout file is [layout.tsx](../../src/layout.tsx)
  this is the global layout folder for the entire application C:\Users\Admin\Documents\projects\portfolio\src\layout
  - Keep the code DRY, create re-useable components if you believe such a component would be reused again
  - Don't repeat typescript types and interfaces across multiple files. create a .model.ts file
  - When creating a new page or component, ensure you implement a component from [index.ts](mdc:src/components/ui/index.ts) or [index.ts](mdc:src/components/reusable/index.ts) . use the components first before considering any code from scratch
  - Always create new files using snake_casing
  
  
- Follow vite, shadcn and tailwind docs for help if need be.
